//! Primary trait for the auth crate (rule 153).

//! `pub(crate)` — consumers never implement this trait. Plug-in
//! extension happens through new `AuthConfig` variants, not
//! external trait impls. The middleware in
//! `core::auth_middleware` holds an `Arc<dyn HttpAuth>` and
//! awaits `process` on each request.
